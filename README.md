# Basics

1. Basics of Octave/ MATLAB / Python (Installation) and basics of plotting data.
2. Create a Sinusoidal Signal y(n) and plot the signal.
3. Create 3 Sinusoidal signal y1, y2, y3. then combine them and plot it.
4. Plot the basic signals like unit impulse, unit samples, unit step, exponential, unit ramp (discussed in classes) etc.
5. Sampling
   * Sampling of a Signal... take a signal then sample using a sampling rate.
   * Sampling Theorem Experiment.
6. Determination of Power Spectrum of a given signal.

# Core
7. 
   * Implement some basic systems like Adder, Multiplier, Delay, Advanced ... etc.
   * Implementing a system from a system input/output equation (i.e. y(n) = .25 y(n-1) + 1.25 x(n-1) + .25 x(n))
8. 
   * Implement Moving average filter, Median Filter, Accumulator etc.
   * Noise removal: Add noise and then remove.
9. Representing a signal using unit impulse signal.
10. Linear Convolution using Equation
11. DFT/IDFT -> Composite Sinusoidal Signal to see the frequencies
12. Program to find the DFT/IDFT
13. Circular convolution program.
14. 
   * Linear Convolution by FFT, IFFT [DFT, IDFT]
   * Circular convolution by FFT, IFFT [DFT, IDFT]
15. Read a .wav, img file and plot them, play / open them. Then apply DFT and plot.
16. Program for Computing auto correlation and cross correlation.

# Filter

17. Implement (design) an FIR Filter → Low Pass
18. Implement (design) an FIR Filter → High Pass
19. Implement (design) an FIR Filter → Band Pass
20. Implement (design) an IIR Filter → Low Pass
21. Implement (design) an IIR Filter → High Pass

# Some Practical Applications:

22. Read a .wav file -> mfcc
23. Read an img file -> resize, reshape, flat ( numpy , openCV )
24. image-> grayscale, resize ... other basic operations (OpenCV)
25. Basic Image Processing Methods
26. Speech Processing -> Filter, Convolution etc.
27. Data Compression (text and image)
